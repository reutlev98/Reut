# Welcome to My GitHub!

## Hi, I'm Reut Lev ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Bioinformatics graduate** from Bar-Ilan University with expertise in **technology**, **data analysis**, and **product management**. I have strong proficiency in multiple programming languages, a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software architecture, and experience in building and managing complex datasets. I enjoy solving challenging problems through technical solutions and working on projects that integrate computational methods with diverse data types.
