<h2 align="left"> About Me</h2>


<p align="left">üñ•Ô∏è  Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've explored a wide range of topics in computer science, gaining expertise in data analysis, SQL, and building datasets, as well as proficiency in multiple programming languages and full-stack development. My experiences also include a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software architecture, which complement my technical skill set. <br><br>üåü  I'm detail-oriented, a quick learner, and passionate about expanding my knowledge, especially in emerging technologies. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I'm always excited to take on new challenges. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or have any questions! </p>

1. **insert the third year project** : 
  
2. **Arkanoid Arcade Game** : Arkanoid arcade game in Java, combining classic gameplay with modern design principles. Leveraged object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and design patterns to enhance the game's robustness and flexibility.

   [Repository](https://github.com/reutlev98/Arkanoid-Game.git)

3. **KNN Classifier Server** : Implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier in C++ with a multithreaded server-client architecture using TCP/IP sockets, enabling efficient classification of numeric CSV test files and supporting multiple clients simultaneously.

   [Repository](https://github.com/reutlev98/KNN-Classifier-Server.git)

4. **Python Projects** : Developed a Monoalphabetic Cipher Breaker using genetic algorithms to decrypt encoded text, and created the Rumor Spreading Simulator to model and predict the spread of rumors within a population. Additionally, implemented a Genetic Algorithm for Neural Network Weight Optimization
